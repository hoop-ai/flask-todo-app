.venv\Scripts\activate
pytest -v
# Screenshot the terminal
# Save to: flask-todo-app/screenshots/pytest_output.png
```
**Shows:** 4 passed, 1 failed test results

#### Screenshot 3: UI Screenshot ‚úÖ ALREADY DONE!
```bash
# Already captured at:
artifacts/ui_after_add.png
# Just verify it exists and looks good
```

**Detailed instructions:** [SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md - Section 1](file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Downloads/Uni/Project%20-%20Software%20Validation/Tasks/flask-todo-app/SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md#1-getting-all-screenshots)
